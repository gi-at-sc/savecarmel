<h2>
<p>There are many friends and residents of Carmel that are against the harmful impacts of the proposed CHS stadium lights, as shown by multiple online petitions (see <a href="https://www.change.org/p/carmel-unified-school-district-save-carmel-from-stadium-lights-protect-the-integrity-of-carmel-s-natural-beauty">here</a> and <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/save-carmel-from-stadium-lights">here</a>) and the many public comments made at CUSD board meetings and submitted on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zE9AeV-VJiOaCjzPfBeZxuSdw_z7CW53/view">the EIR</a>. Despite the EIR admitting that the impact of the light pollution will be "significant and unavoidable", CUSD chose to ignore this and other major concerns, and still approved the project.</p>

<p>However, there is no formal "Save Carmel" organization, at least not one that is associated with savecarmel.org, and there is certainly no one person that speaks for the many people against the lights. There are some folks behind a lawsuit against the CHS stadium lights, but none of the folks associated with this website are involved with that lawsuit in any way whatsoever.</p>
